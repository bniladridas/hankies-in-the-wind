# hankies-in-the-wind

## Key Points

- **Project name:** hankies-in-the-wind
- **Minimal scripts:** dev, build, lint, preview, test
- **Core dependencies:**
  - React (UI)
  - Three.js (animation)
  - Gemini API via @google/genai (AI chat)
- **Minimal configuration:** TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, ESLint

## AI Technology

This project uses the [Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/) from Google to provide AI-powered chat features. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by Google. All AI responses are generated by Google’s Gemini model via the public API.

## AI Memory Feature

The AI chat includes an automatic memory system. The AI tries to extract and remember facts from the conversation (e.g., "My name is John", "I live in Paris") and uses these facts to provide more personalized, context-aware responses. The memory mode is always automatic and cannot be changed by the user.

The memory logic is robustly tested using [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/). See `src/utils/memory.test.ts` for the test suite, which covers:
- Storing and retrieving facts
- Preventing duplicate facts
- Automatic fact extraction
- Persistence in localStorage
- Handling malformed data and edge cases

## Essential Files

- `src/` — All source code (components, services, styles)
- `index.html` — Minimal HTML entry point
- `package.json` and `package-lock.json` — Project dependencies and scripts
- `tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.app.json`, `tsconfig.node.json` — TypeScript configuration
- `vite.config.ts` — Vite build configuration
- `tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js` — Tailwind CSS and PostCSS configuration
- `eslint.config.js` — ESLint configuration
- `README.md` — Project documentation

All other files and folders are either generated during build (`dist/`, `node_modules/`) or are not required for the app to run or develop.

## Project Commands

- `npm run dev` — Start the development server
- `npm run build` — Build the project for production
- `npm run lint` — Run the linter to check for code quality issues
- `npm run lint -- --fix` — Automatically fix fixable lint issues
- `npm run test` — Run the Vitest test suite
- `npm run` — List all available npm scripts

## Running Tests

To run the test suite for the memory logic (and any other tests), use:

```sh
npm run test
```

This will execute all tests using Vitest and display the results in your terminal.
